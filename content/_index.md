# Libertas Publica

## Description

Libertas Publica is an organization that recognizes the importance of information as a
public good and protects informational rights and freedoms. We strive to create a society
where information is accessible to all and where the protection of informational rights and
freedoms is a priority.

## Core Principles

We, recognizing the importance of information as a public good and the necessity of protecting
informational rights and freedoms, support the following principles:

1. **Principle of Accessibility and Openness**: All information necessary for the development
   of society and science should be accessible to everyone without exception, including the
   rights to access, use, and distribution.
2. **Principle of Copyright and Public Domain**: Copyright should take into account public
   interests and should not hinder free access to information after a certain period or when
   reaching a certain audience.
3. **Principle of Digital Ethics and Transparency**: The use of digital technologies and
   platforms should adhere to ethical standards, transparency, and the protection
   of personal data.
4. **Principle of Fighting Censorship and Control**: Censorship and control over information
   are threats to freedom of speech and expression, and they should be opposed at all levels
   of society.
5. **Principle of Education and Awareness**: All members of society should have access
   to education in the field of digital technologies, informational rights, and freedoms
   to effectively use and protect their rights.
